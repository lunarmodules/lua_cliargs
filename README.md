cliargs is a command-line argument parser for Lua. It supports several types of arguments:

1. required arguments
2. optional arguments with different notations: `-short-key VALUE` and/or `--expanded-key=VALUE`
3. optional arguments with multiple-values that get appended to a list
4. optional "flag" arguments (on/off options) with notations: `-short-key` and/or `--expanded-key`
5. a single optional "splat" argument which can be repeated (must be the last argument)

Optional arguments can have default values (strings), flags always default to 'true'.

## Usage Examples

See the examples under the `examples/` directory.

## API

See http://lua-cliargs.netlify.com/ for the API docs.

## Help listings `--help`

A help listing will be automatically generated and accessed using the `--help` argument. When such an option is encountered, `cli:parse()` will abort and return `nil, string` with the help message; you are free to print it to the screen using `print()` if you want.

You can also force its display in the code using `cli:print_help()`.

This is the result for our example (see `examples/00_general.lua`):

```
Usage: cli_example.lua [OPTIONS]  INPUT  [OUTPUT-1 [OUTPUT-2 [...]]]

ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT                 path to the input file (required)
  OUTPUT                multiple output paths (optional, default:
                        /dev/stdout)

OPTIONS:
  -c, --compress=FILTER the filter to use for compressing output: gzip,
                        lzma, bzip2, or none (default: gzip)
  -o FILE               path to output file (default: /dev/stdout)
  -d                    script will run in DEBUG mode
  -v, --version         prints the program's version and exits
  --verbose             the script output will be very verbose
```

## Validations

### Runtime argument validation

From a parsing point of view, there are 3 cases that need to be handled which are outlined below. If I missed something, please open a ticket!

**Missing a required argument**

```
$ lua examples/00_general.lua
cli_example.lua: error: bad number of arguments; 1-4 argument(s) must be specified, not 0; re-run with --help for usage.
```

**Missing value for an optional argument**

```
$ lua examples/00_general.lua --compress inputfile
cli_example.lua: error: option --compress requires a value to be set; re-run with --help for usage.
```

**Unknown arguments**

```
$ lua examples/00_general.lua -f inputfile
cli_example.lua: error: unknown/bad flag; -f; re-run with --help for usage.
```

### Some sanity guards

In the following cases, `cliargs` will report an error to you and terminate the running script:

1. flag options can not accept a value. For example: `cli:add_flag('-v VERSION')` will return an error
2. duplicate keys are not allowed: defining two options with the key `--input` will be rejected

## Tests

Running test specs is done using [busted](http://olivinelabs.com/busted/). You can install it using [LuaRocks](http://www.luarocks.org/), and then just call it with the `spec` folder:

```
luarocks install busted
cd /path/to/lua_cliargs/
busted spec
```

## Changelog

### Changes from 3.x to 4.0

This release contains only a single change but since it breaks the API it is
published as a major release.

Splat arguments were reworked so that they allow for unlimited repititions
**by default** (see [GH-54](https://github.com/amireh/lua_cliargs/issues/54)
for more context.)

Previously, if you were defining a splat argument _without_ specifying a 
`maxcount` value (the 4th argument) the library would assume a maxcount of 1, 
indicating that your splat argument is just an optional argument and will be 
provided as a string value instead of a table.

If you need to maintain this behavior, you must now explicitly set the maxcount
to `1`:

```lua
-- version 3
cli:splat('MY_SPLAT', 'Description')

-- version 4
cli:splat('MY_SPLAT', 'Description', nil, 1)
```

Also, the library internally had an arbitrary limit of 999 repetitions for the
splat argument. That limit has been relieved.

### 3.0-2

- optimized an internal routine responsible for word-wrapping. Thanks to
  @Tieske, refs GH-47

### Changes from 2.5.x 3.0

This major version release contains BREAKING API CHANGES. See the UPGRADE guide for help in updating your code to make use of it.

**More flexible parsing**

- options can occur anywhere now even after arguments (unless the `--` indicator is specified, then no options are parsed afterwards.) Previously, options were accepted only before arguments.
- options using the short-key notation can be specified using `=` as a value delimiter as well as a space (e.g. `-c=lzma` and `-c lzma`)
- the library is now more flexible with option definitions (notations like `-key VALUE`, `--key=VALUE`, `-k=VALUE` are all treated equally)
- `--help` or `-h` will now cause the help listing to be displayed no matter where they are. Previously, this only happened if they were supplied as the first option.

**Basic command support**

You may now define commands with custom handlers. A command may be invoked by supplying its name as the first argument (options can still come before or afterwards). lua_cliargs will forward the rest of the options to that command to handle, which can be in a separate file.

See `examples/04_commands--git.lua` for an example.

**Re-defining defaults**

It is now possible to pass a table containing default values (and override any 
existing defaults).

The function for doing this is called `cli:load_defaults().`.

This makes it possible to load run-time defaults from a configuration file, for example.

**Reading configuration files**

`cliargs` now exposes some convenience helpers for loading configuration from files (and a separate hook, `cli:load_defaults()` to inject this config if you want) found in `cli:read_defaults()`. This method takes a file-path and an optional file format and it will parse it for you, provided you have the necessary libraries installed.

See the API docs for using this hook.

**Other changes**

- internal code changes and more comprehensive test-coverage

### Changes from 2.5.1 to 2.5.2

- No longer tracking the (legacy) tarballs in git or the luarocks package. Instead, we use the GitHub release tarballs for each version.

### Changes in 2.4.0 from 2.3-4

1. All arguments now accept a callback that will be invoked when parsing of those arguments was successful
2. (**POSSIBLY BREAKING**) Default value for flags is now `nil` instead of `false`. This will only affect existing behavior if you were explicitly testing unset flags to equal `false` (i.e. `if flag == false then`) as opposed to `if flag then` (or `if not flag then`).
3. Minor bugfixes

### Changes in 2.3.0

1. the parser will now understand `--` to denote the end of optional arguments and will map whatever comes after it to required/splat args
2. `-short VALUE` is now properly supported, so is `-short=VALUE`
3. short-key options can now officially be composed of more than 1 character
4. the parser now accepts callbacks that will be invoked as soon as options are parsed so that you can bail out of parsing preemptively (like for `--version` or `--help` options)
5. options can now accept multiple values via multiple invocations if a table was provided as a default value (passed-in values will be appended to that list)

### Changes in 2.2-0 from 2.1-2

1. the `=` that separates keys from values in the `--expanded-key` notation is no longer mandatory; using either a space or a `=` will map the value to the key (e.g., `--compress lzma` is equal to `--compress=lzma`)

### Changes in 2.0.0 from 1.x.x

1. added the 'splat' argument, an optional repetitive argument for which a maximum number of occurrences can be set
1. removed the reference, arguments are now solely returned by their key/expanded-key (BREAKING!)
1. removed object overhead and the `new()` method as the library will only be used once on program start-up (BREAKING!)
1. after parsing completed successfully, the library will effectively delete itself to free resources (BREAKING!)
1. option/flag is now allowed with only an expanded-key defined
1. Debug aid implemented; adding a first option `--__DUMP__`, will dump the results of parsing the command line. Especially for testing how to use the commandline with arguments containing spaces either quoted or not.
1. the `print_usage()` and `print_help()` now have a 'noprint' parameter that will not print the message, but return it as an error string (`nil + errmsg`)
